# Include this in Cursor general rules for every project:

# Fundamental Principles

- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code.
- Use clear and easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.

# Error Fixing

= DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.

- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- In case of trange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information

# Building Process

- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search

# Comments

- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into out code
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong / obsolete
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well-documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE
- When writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language, write in short sentences.
